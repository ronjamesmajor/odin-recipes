        <li>1 Egg.</li>
        <li>3 tbsp Corn Flour.</li>
        <li>10 tbsp All-Purpose Flour.</li>
        <li>&frac12; tsp Garlic Powder.</li>
        <li>2 tsp Paprika Powder.</li>
        <li>Around 5 tsp vegetable oil for frying.</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Sauce</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tsp Sesame Oil.</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, mashed to paste.</li>
        <li>1 tbsp Chinese Rice Vinegar.</li>
        <li>3 tbsp Honey.</li>
        <li>2 tbpsp Ketchup.</li>
        <li>2 tbsp Brown Sugar.</li>
        <li>4 tbsp Soy Sauce.</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the sauce by mixing the ingredients together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Cut the chicken into bite sized pieces.</li>
        <li>Place all-purpose flour in a shallow bowl. Mix in garlic powder as well as salt and pepper, &frac12; tsp each.</li>
        <li>Place lightly beaten egg in another shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Coat the chicken in corn flour, dip it in egg and finally coat with seasoned all purpose-flour.</li>
        <li>Heat a good amount of oil on a pan to fry the chicken in. The oil should be hot enough so that the chicken sizzles when placed in the pan. You may want to do this in a couple of batches depending on the size of your pan.</li>
        <li>Fry until chicken is cooked and has a nice golden-brownish coating.</li>
        <li>Pour out excess oil, put the sauce in and mix to coat the chicken. Or place the chicken in a bowl with kitchen towels and do another batch.</li>
        <li>Let the sauce bubble for one or two minutes and youâ€™re done.</li>
        <li>Serve with boiled rice.</li>
    </ol>
