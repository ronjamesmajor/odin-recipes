An HTML chops exercise from Odin Project.
Step one will be to set up the HTML Boilerplate.
Step two will be to do the assignment itself. (links, lists, images, etc)
Step three will be to do commit cycles throughout.
Step four will be to review what I have learned.
Step five will be to push all commits and follow up at the end.
